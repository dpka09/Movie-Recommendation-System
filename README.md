**Model deploy using Streamlit on Render Platform**

In this project I have implemented a content based movie recommender system. The algorithm recommends products that are similar to the ones a user has preferred in the past. This similarity (generally cosine similarity) is computed from the data we have about the items as well as the past preferences of the user.

**How it works:**

Content Based Filtering - They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This filter applies item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for films in recommending these items. The fundamental idea behind such recommender systems is that if someone liked a particular item, he or she will like an item with a similar nature.
